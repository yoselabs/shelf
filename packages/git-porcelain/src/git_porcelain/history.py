"""Commits, history and the remote — the part of git a program that owns a repo needs.

A host that writes files and wants every change in history calls :func:`commit_paths`
with exactly the paths it touched: whatever else the user left staged or dirty is not
swept in. Identity is passed per call, so a machine with no ``user.name`` still commits,
and hooks are skipped, so a hook cannot silently stop history. :func:`log_grep` and
:func:`show_at` read that history back; :func:`push` and :func:`fetch` talk to the remote
and raise :class:`RemoteError` with a ``reason`` a host can act on (offline, auth,
rejected). :func:`merge` brings a fetched branch in with the host's identity and no hooks,
and says plainly what happened (fast-forward, merge commit, conflict, or blocked by a local
edit); :func:`finish_merge` completes a conflicted merge once a person has removed the
markers, without making them run ``git add``.
