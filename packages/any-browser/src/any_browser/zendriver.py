"""ZendriverBackend — a CDP rendering engine behind the ``BrowserBackend`` seam.

The robust rung: a browser driven directly over CDP, complementary to the
Playwright-API drop-ins (Camoufox/Patchright) — the SPAs one engine fails to
read, another can. This backend is also the proof the interface spans engine
*families*, not just the Playwright API: zendriver drives Chromium over CDP
(its own ``Browser``/``Tab`` objects, no Playwright ``Page``), so unlike
Patchright it cannot be a :class:`PlaywrightBackend` launch_fn — it implements
``render(...)`` itself and shapes CDP navigation / content / cookies into the
same consumer-free :class:`RenderedPage`.

**Per-render browser launch**, no host pool (the simplest correct shape,
perfect per-render isolation, several times slower than the pooled fast rung).
A shared pool is a known, deferred optimization, low urgency because the cost
only bites once a faster engine has already failed to read the page.

Consumer-free: only :class:`RenderedPage` crosses the boundary — never a
``Tab``, CDP session, or consumer type. Reuses the engine-neutral helpers from
:mod:`any_browser.playwright` so the one-line summary + thin-floor heuristic
stay identical across engines.
