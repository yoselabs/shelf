"""The dead-rung guard's decision logic — deterministic, runs in the DEFAULT gate.

This file is deliberately NOT `browser`-marked. Its subject is the skip→fail
policy (`browser_unavailable_policy`), not any real engine, so it needs no
Chromium and runs in `make check` on every commit.

Why it can't live in `test_browser_smoke.py`: that module is `browser`-marked
and therefore deselected from the default gate, AND the FAIL branch it guards is
one a *working* browser can never exercise — a real launch succeeds, so the
"required but absent" path never fires even in the CI browser lane. The only way
to keep that branch honest is a deterministic test, in the gate, that forces
`required=True` with no browser in sight. Precisely the branch that stayed
plausible-looking while a robust rung shipped dead-on-launch.
