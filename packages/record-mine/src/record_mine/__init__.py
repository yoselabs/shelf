"""record-mine — locate and extract repeated data records from HTML.

A listing / index / threaded-discussion page is N repeated records, not one
article. Article extractors (trafilatura and friends) discard that repeated
structure as boilerplate; this package recovers it: a tree-aware detector
locates the dominant repeated record region (`detector`), and a depth-aware
renderer turns it into link-preserving markdown (`render`). Boundary types
live in `models`.

Public surface: `extract_records(html, base_url) -> RecordSet | None`.
